When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Use a remote repository for collaboration projects between users on various computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Such changes may not be necessary and thus you wouldn't want them automatically pulled.

Forks are for use on github, clones for use in the cmd log, and branches in the cmd log as well.
